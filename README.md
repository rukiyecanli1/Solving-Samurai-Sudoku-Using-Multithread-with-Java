# Solving-Samurai-Sudoku-Using-Multithread-with-Java
 Thanks to the project, a solution can be found by using 5 threads for 5 starting points and 10 threads for 10 starting points over the samurai sudoku to be given. Sudoku initial values will be dynamically transferred to the application from the .tx t file. In addition, the durations of the two solution methods can be compared graphically.
